Hardware and Software files of  IEEE publication: Ambient Backscatterers using FM Broadcasting for Low Cost and Low Power Wireless Applications


In this repo we proposed proof-of-concept tag
comprises of an ultra-low-power microcontroller (MCU) and a
radio frequency front-end for wireless communication. The MCU
can accumulate data from multiple sensors through an analog-todigital converter, while it transmits the information back to the
receiver through the front-end by means of backscattering. The
front-end uses On-Off keying modulation and FM0 encoding on
ambient FM station signals. The receiver consists of a commercial
low-cost software defined radio which downconverts the received
signal to baseband and decodes it using a suitable signal
processing algorithm.
