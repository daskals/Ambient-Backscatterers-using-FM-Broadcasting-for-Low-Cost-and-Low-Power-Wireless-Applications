The proposed tag prototype consists of a MSP430 development board
[1] connected with an RF front-end board. The RF front-end consists of the
ADG902 RF switch and was fabricated using inkjet printing technology on
a paper substrate. A MCU digital output pin was connected with the control
signal of the RF switch [2]. The operation power of RF front-end was supplied
by the MCU development board and the whole system was supplied by an
embedded super capacitor for duty cycle operation.
